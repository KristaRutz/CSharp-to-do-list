#### By _**Andrew Philpott, Sasa Schwartz, Jiwon Han, Jack Dunning**_

## Description

This application allows you to see how fast you're typing, as well as race against your friends. You are provided with 100 words worth of dad jokes as you type. As you type, the text will shift and change color to display which letters you typed correctly and incorrectly. You can correct your errors within a word, but once you complete a word you can't go back! When you finish typing, the game will display your words per minute, characters per minute, and number of errors.
